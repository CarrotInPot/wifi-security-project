- These instructions will guide you through finding the necessary information about your Wi-Fi network.
- After reviewing your current Wi-Fi settings, scroll to the bottom of the page and click the **"Next Step"** button to proceed to the **"WiFi Security Analysis Framework"** page.

### 4. Select Security Protocol
- In the first dropdown labeled **"Security Protocol (WEP, WPA2, etc.)"**, choose the Wi-Fi security protocol your network is currently using.
- Examples of protocols include **WEP**, **WPA**, **WPA2**, and **WPA3**.

### 5. Select Encryption Type
- In the second dropdown labeled **"Encryption Type (AES, TKIP, etc.)"**, select the type of encryption your Wi-Fi network is using.
- Common encryption types include **AES**, **TKIP**, **CCMP**, and **GCMP**.

### 6. Choose Your Network Usage
- Select the type of network usage by choosing one of the following options:
  - **Home**: If your Wi-Fi network is used for personal and family devices.

  - **Business**: If your network is used in an office or business environment where sensitive data is handled.

### 7. Generate a Recommendation
- After selecting the options for the **Security Protocol**, **Encryption Type**, and **Usage**, click the **"Generate Recommendation"** button.
- The tool will generate a tailored recommendation based on your selections.

### 8. Review the Recommendation
- A recommendation will appear in a colored box (Red, Orange, or Green) based on the level of urgency:
  - **Red (High Alert)**: Immediate action is required to improve your network security.
  - **Orange (Medium Alert)**: Consider upgrading your network security to protect against emerging threats.
  - **Green (Low Alert)**: Your network security is up-to-date and no immediate changes are necessary.
- The recommendation will include steps you can take to improve your network security. These steps may involve upgrading your security protocol, encryption, or consulting an IT professional.

### 9. View General Best Practices
- Click the **"View General Best Practices"** button to access a list of general Wi-Fi security recommendations. These best practices will help you maintain a secure network and protect your data.

### 10. Understand Router/Modem Limitations
- At the bottom of the recommendation, there is a note indicating that some security upgrades might be limited by the capabilities of your router or modem.
- If your router or modem does not support newer security standards like WPA3, you may need to upgrade your hardware. Check your routerâ€™s specifications or contact an IT professional for guidance.

### 11. Saving Recommendations
- The recommendations you receive are automatically saved, and you can revisit them by accessing the **"Saved Recommendations"** section in the navigation bar.
